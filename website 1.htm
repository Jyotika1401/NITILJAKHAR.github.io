    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    
    
    <h3>The Mars 2020 mission will seek the signs of ancient life on 
Mars and will identify, prepare, document, and cache a set of samples 
for possible return to Earth by a follow-on mission. Mars 2020 and its 
Perseverance rover thus link and further two long-held goals in 
planetary science: a deep search for evidence of life in a habitable 
extraterrestrial environment, and the return of martian samples to Earth
 for analysis in terrestrial laboratories.</h3> 
      <h4>  The Mars 2020 spacecraft is based on the design of the 
highly successful Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity rover, but 
outfitted with a sophisticated suite of new science instruments. 
Ground-penetrating radar will illuminate geologic structures in the 
shallow subsurface, while a multi-faceted weather station will document 
martian environmental conditions. Several instruments can be used 
individually or in tandem to map the color, texture, chemistry, and 
mineralogy of rocks and regolith at the meter scale and at the 
submillimeter scale. The science instruments will be used to interpret 
the geology of the landing site, to identify habitable 
paleoenvironments, to seek ancient textural, elemental, mineralogical 
and organic biosignatures, and to locate and characterize the most 
promising samples for Earth return. Once selected, ∼35 samples of rock 
and regolith weighing about 15 grams each will be drilled directly into 
ultraclean and sterile sample tubes. Perseverance will also collect 
blank sample tubes to monitor the evolving rover contamination 
environment. 
        In addition to its scientific instruments, Perseverance hosts 
technology demonstrations designed to facilitate future Mars 
exploration. These include a device to generate oxygen gas by 
electrolytic decomposition of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and a small 
helicopter to assess performance of a rotorcraft in the thin martian 
atmosphere. 
        Mars 2020 entry, descent, and landing (EDL) will use the same 
approach that successfully delivered Curiosity to the martian surface, 
but with several new features that enable the spacecraft to land at 
previously inaccessible landing sites. A suite of cameras and a 
microphone will for the first time capture the sights and sounds of EDL.
 
        Mars 2020’s landing site was chosen to maximize scientific 
return of the mission for astrobiology and sample return. Several 
billion years ago Jezero crater held a 40 km diameter, few 
hundred-meter-deep lake, with both an inflow and an outflow channel. A 
prominent delta, fine-grained lacustrine sediments, and 
carbonate-bearing rocks offer attractive targets for habitability and 
for biosignature preservation potential. In addition, a possible 
volcanic unit in the crater and impact megabreccia in the crater rim, 
along with fluvially-deposited clasts derived from the large and 
lithologically diverse headwaters terrain, contribute substantially to 
the science value of the sample cache for investigations of the history 
of Mars and the Solar System. Even greater diversity, including very 
ancient aqueously altered rocks, is accessible in a notional rover 
traverse that ascends out of Jezero crater and explores the surrounding 
Nili Planum. 
        Mars 2020 is conceived as the first element of a multi-mission 
Mars Sample Return campaign. After Mars 2020 has cached the samples, a 
follow-on mission consisting of a fetch rover and a rocket could 
retrieve and package them, and then launch the package into orbit. A 
third mission could capture the orbiting package and return it to Earth.
 To facilitate the sample handoff, Perseverance could deposit its 
collection of filled sample tubes in one or more locations, called 
depots, on the planet’s surface. Alternatively, if Perseverance remains 
functional, it could carry some or all the samples directly to the 
retrieval spacecraft. 
        The Mars 2020 mission and its Perseverance rover launched from 
the Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on July 
30, 2020. Landing at Jezero Crater will occur on Feb 18, 2021 at about 
12:30 PM Pacific Time.</h4>
